# IMPORTANT!!!

Insomnia needs some trouble shooting. I'll include a video for this application once I speak with my Instructor on how to get Insomnia up and running again!

## Desciption

Welcome to my E-commerce Back End. An app using Mysql, Node, Express, Sequelize, and JavaScript to deliver functionality to the backend of an E-commerce application. It's purpose is to help it's users keep track of their inventory.

## Installation

To install this application you must download it's source code. ONce the source code is on you local machine, install npm, mysql, and express. Once done you can use this application via the command line.

## Usage

Use this application by navigating to it's root directory and entering mysql -u root -p then enter your mysql password. From there select it's database 'ecommerce_db' and run the command 'source db/schema.sql'. Enter 'quit' in the Mysql command line to exit the Mysql command line. Then type 'node run seed' to seed the databases table.
Once done use Insomnia to try out the application.
